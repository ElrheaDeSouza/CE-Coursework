# Computer Engineering Projects & Assignments

This repository contains my projects, codes, and assignments from my ongoing studies in Computer Engineering. Each semester's work is organized in its respective folder, and I'll be updating this repository as I progress through my course.

## Repository Structure
- **Sem2/**:Introduction to programming (C programming).
- **Sem3/**:Data Structures, Object-Oriented Programming.
- **Sem4/**:Modern Algorithms and Design Foundation, Assemby,Mathematical Foundation for AIML.
- **Sem5/**: (Work to be updated as semester progresses)
- **Sem6-8/**:(Work to be added in future Semesters)

## Current Progress

I have currently completed up to Semester 4. This repository will be continuously updated as I move through the remaining semesters.

## Technologies Used (so far)

- Programming Languages: C, C++, Java, Python
- Web Development: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- Tools: Git, VS Code, MySQL

## How to Use

1. Navigate to the relevant semester folder.
2. Each folder contains subfolders for individual subjects or projects.
